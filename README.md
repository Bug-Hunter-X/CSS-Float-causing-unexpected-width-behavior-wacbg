# CSS Float causing unexpected width behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `float` property in CSS.  The `div` elements are floated left, but they do not occupy the full width of their container. This is because the parent container doesn't collapse to accommodate the floated children.  A solution is provided to demonstrate how to resolve this problem.
