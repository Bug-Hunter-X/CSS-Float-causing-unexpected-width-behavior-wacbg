The issue can be solved by adding the following CSS rule to the parent container:

```css
.parent {
  overflow: hidden;  /* Or auto */ 
}
```

By setting `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: auto` on the parent container, the parent will collapse to fit the floated children, resulting in the expected layout.  Here is the updated CSS:

```css
.parent {
  overflow: hidden;
}
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```
